# Portfolio Built at Sparta

This Portfolio will be in constant process of update along with new knowledge obtained during my 12 weeks training at Sparta Global.

For now it's made of only one main page, where, by scrolling down, the user can navigate and see a small section "About" me, some "Courses" that I've enrolled so far, "Skills" and "Contact".

### What to Improve
1. Responsiveness
  * The current code is still not very responsive
2. Nav-bar
3. Scrolling
4. Main image section
  * The current size of the main picture looks too big
5. Progress bars
  * I intend to add progress bars bellow every skills icon

### Main Difficulties
1. Media queries
2. Align items in the page
3. Nav-bar
4. Make it Responsive
5. Text over image
  * I intend to write a quote on the main image (the code is commented on index.html and style.css), but still didn't manage to make it work without making changes in the main content area.

### What I like it the most
1. Clean webpage
  * Clean in the visual aspect of the word
2. Allusive images and vivid colors
  * This captures the attention of the user
