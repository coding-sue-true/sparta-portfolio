            <p>
              Sometime ago I heard in a TED conference something that would ultimately impact me - “shape your brain
              the way you want it to be”. That’s what I do every day. My drive is to learn as much as I can to improve
              myself. Using some learning websites like Coursera and Udemy, I'm trying to start a new career path
              directed towards Web Development, which has been a long passion of mine. In a few years, I plan to be
              developing AI softwares and exploring this particular area, which I believe will shape the way we perceive
              the world.

              Around five years ago I was finishing my graduation in Lisbon, in Cultural Anthropology. I always had particular interest in human brain, how it allow us Humans to adjust to different environments, how we learn, how we feel, see, taste, etc.

              Never thought 5 years later I would be enrolling in an opportunity do develop my interest more deeply at Sparta Global.
